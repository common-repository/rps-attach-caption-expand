Makes the caption field on the edit attachment page a textarea, and enables HTML markup in the caption.

== Description ==

This plugin expands the caption field of the Edit Media page to a larger text field (text area) so that long captions are easier to read and edit. In addition, it also enables HTML markup in the caption so that your captions may be more stylish and expressive. If you require support for the inline Tiny MCE Image Editor plugin's caption field as well, additional core files which provide these changes are included with the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `rps-attach-caption-expand` folder containing all of the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. **(optional)** For Tiny MCE Image Editor plugin support, copy `tinymce/editimage.html` to `/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wpeditimage/` and `tinymce/editimage.js` to `/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wpeditimage/js`. *NOTE: Replacing WordPress core files is potentially dangerous. Do this step at your own risk.*
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
